The Facebook protocol plugin for bitlbee. This plugin uses the Facebook
Mobile API.

Building and Installing:
  Make sure bitlbee and its headers have been installed. If bitlbee came
  from the distribution's repository, it will most likely need the
  development package, usually bitlbee-dev.

  If bitlbee was built by hand (or alike via a script), ensure the make
  target `install-dev` is invoked. This target is not called by default,
  and will install the headers that are needed.

  Do *not* use the source tree headers unless you know what you are
  doing. This can lead to mismatched header versions, which often times
  will lead to bad things.

  $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-facebook.git
  $ cd bitlbee-facebook

  With a "global" (or system) bitlbee installation:
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ make install

  Or with a "local" bitlbee installation (location: $HOME/bitlbee):
    $ export BITLBEE_CFLAGS="-I$HOME/bitlbee/include/bitlbee"
    $ export BITLBEE_LIBS=""
    $ ./autogen.sh --libdir=$HOME/bitlbee/lib
    $ make
    $ make install

Usage:
  Before continuing, please note, it is recommended that you use an app
  password for your Facebook account. Not only is this more secure than
  leaving your password within bitlbee, but it allows the usage of two
  factor authentication methods. An app password can be generated via
  the security page on the Facebook website.

  Getting started:
    > account add facebook <username> <password>
    > account <acc> on

  Group Chats (existing chat):
    > fbchats [acc]
    > fbjoin [acc] <index> <channel>
    > /join #<channel>
    > /topic <message>
    > /invite <user>

  Group Chats (creating chat):
    > fbcreate [acc] <user,user,...>
    > fbjoin [acc] 1 <channel>
    > /join #<channel>
    > /topic <message>
    > /invite <user>

Debugging:
  Before debugging can begin, the plugin must be compiled with debugging
  support. Once debugging support has been enabled, one of the two
  supported environment variables can be defined to enable debugging
  output. This can be used in unison with debuggers such as GDB, which
  should enable easier tracing of bugs.

  When posting to the issue tracker, please ensure any sensitive
  information has been stripped.

  Enable debugging support (modify the build instructions above):
    $ ./autogen.sh --enable-debug

  Enable debugging output:
    For bitlbee and the plugin:
      $ export BITLBEE_DEBUG=1
      OR
      $ BITLBEE_DEBUG=1 gdb ...

    For just the plugin:
      $ export BITLBEE_DEBUG_FACEBOOK=1
      OR
      $ BITLBEE_DEBUG_FACEBOOK=1 gdb ...

  Obtaining a GDB backtrace:
    $ gdb \
        -ex 'handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass' \
        -ex 'break g_log' -ex run -ex bt \
        --args /usr/sbin/bitlbee -Dnvc /etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf
